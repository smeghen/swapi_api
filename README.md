# SWAPI API 

This is a basic api data call to the SWAPI API resource located at https://swapi.dev/

For this particular I am accessing the people of the Star Wars unsiverse, capturing their details of:
*	Name
*	Height
*	Mass
*	Created
*	Edited


The captured data is then dsiplayed on a single page using a responsive Bootstrap table.
